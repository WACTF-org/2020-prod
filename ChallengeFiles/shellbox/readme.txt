Hi player!

This container is used to help you receive call backs (like reverse shells) from other containers. You can also use it to probe or troubleshoot a challenge.

Every container has strict inbound firewall rules so you can only accept reverse shells on these ports:

1337
2222
3333
4444
8000
8080

You won’t be able to establish any bind shells to containers because of the firewall rules.

Good luck, and have fun!

Note: You can report security vulnerabilities in this container to organisers for points under the “Zero (Day) Cool” Miscellaneous challenge.
