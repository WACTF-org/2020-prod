So go-sqlite3 fucking sucks. Big surprise? Anyway. It basically doesn't compile. Compiling with `CGO_ENABLED=0` produces this error: 2020/11/17 02:36:54 Binary was compiled with 'CGO_ENABLED=0', go-sqlite3 requires cgo to work. This is a stub`. Compiling without CGO causes the docker interpreter to bail out. The following works, however

from kali (linux/amd64 build):

`sudo go build -ldflags "-linkmode external -extldflags -static" main.go`
# command-line-arguments
/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/go-link-081399395/000010.o: in function `unixDlOpen':

scp hax:/tmp/app/main app/toctou

Seems to work?
