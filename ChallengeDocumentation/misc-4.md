|Challenge Description | Sonic needs to run to the right! The flag is to the right! RUN TO THE RIGHT. The flag might not render correctly. But the important part does. You'll be fine. Just run to the right. | 
|Challenge Hint 1 | A bug seems to be stopping you from running to the right :( | 
|Challenge Hint 2 | BizHawk is a pretty good emulator |
|Challenge Hint 3 | Which value controls how far right you are? Maybe you can change it and make it past the invisible wall!?! |
