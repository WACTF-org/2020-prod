|Challenge Flag| WACTF{isnt_git_great} |
|Challenge Vuln| Templated web app with `.git` dir present in `/env/.git`. A basic blacklist has been set to require challenge players to configure their chosen dir-bustering tool with the requisite user-agent option. Within the git repo is a flag that has been added and removed, and has been followed by a bunch of other commits just to fill out the log. |
